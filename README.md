# Toronto Airbnb Data Analysis


Data analysis for a Medium article about Toronto City with Airbnb data | Data Science | Python | Udacity Nanodegree

In this notebook we'll be exploring the data from AirBnb Barcelona dataset http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html published in year 2019. Datasets involves insights of interest related to prices, neigbourhoods, avalability or room types in the city.

Unfortunately there was no data about 'Neighbourhoods' of the city that I wanted to analyse. So I manually added neighbourhoods. I took that data from wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighbourhoods_in_Toronto

I mostly tried to answer my questions to don't know anything about Toronto at all. I am also in that group was thinking to go for traveling around Toronto in couple of months. So, questions been answered about the prices, popular districts, popular months, preferable places by districts and type of rooms etc. like everyone needs to know about before travel or settle. Even for a short term or a long term.
